In c code, please change the number input in r to the wanted integer number                    
  ex: uint32_t r= 1024 ;//wanted integer number;                           
In assembly code, please change the input number to the wanted integer number                            
  ex:   input: .word 1024 #wanted integer number                           

both of the output are: After #n iterations, the square root of #wanted number is #answer;
